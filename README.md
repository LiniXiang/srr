# SRR: Structure Reliability Representation

srr is an ontology integrated with mechanical concepts, which are used for reliability analysis and calculation of structural systems. This ontology includes two reliability analysis methods, Monte Carlo  and First Order Second Moment. It can be extended with other mechanical ontology to express a wider range of structure ontology. There are two ways to expand:

* Increase other mechanical physical quantities (except reliability).
* Keep the reliability there and consider more complex design. e.g. importing heterogeneous uncertainties from different stages of the building and various factors in load, materials, scale.
* Define more paths solving the limit function.
